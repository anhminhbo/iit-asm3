          We discussed about it and eventually decided on a new group name,
          rather than each person’s current group name. We arrive at the name
          MKDK. We believe this is the greatest and most equitable name for
          everyone since it is the first letters for each of our names.

              Everyone can call me Minh for short, I have worked as a developer
              before, so I have little experience in researching and coding. I
              used to do programming on the backend side which requires lots of
              knowledge, therefore, I have good problem solving and
              easy-to-learn new things. My hobbies are programming, playing
              games, and spending time with my family. Moreover, I am interested
              in backend development. Anyway, I have not thought about the
              team's name yet. But I may name it Never Give Up because it has
              been an exceptionally long journey since I started to switch my
              major into IT field, I have been through tough time to finally
              decide to study in IT, and never give up is the slogan I used to
              motivate myself.

              I'm currently in Hoi An, my hometown, which is a rather secure
              place to be despite the pandemic. I'd like to increase my IT
              skills since I enjoy working with algorithms and data and applying
              what I've learnt. After graduating from high school in July, I
              discovered RMIT University is the perfect place to learn, grow,
              and make new friends. In my spare time, I enjoy reading novels or
              playing games to keep myself entertained. Between now and then, I
              intend to pursue a career in both cyber security and video game
              production. I only have a basic knowledge of IT, but I believe I
              could pick it up quickly, and I'm constantly trying to broaden my
              knowledge.

              I was born and grew up in Ho Chi Minh city – Vietnam. During my
              study in high school, I took great interest in English and Math.
              One of my favorite things to do in my leisure time is drawing. I
              also enjoy learning new languages and playing video games. On top
              of all that, I am more interested in technology, and especially
              the coding field. I started to develop my interest for the field
              in the mid of high school and having been exposed to how
              technology worked, my passion for it continued to grow. Being an
              introvert and a very shy person, I am unconfident about myself, so
              i wanted to study in an international environment to build up what
              I am still lacking. Hence, I chose to study IT at RMIT University.
              I may not have any IT experience before, but I believe I will gain
              many academic and soft skills during my time here.

              Incipiently, everyone can call me Ben for short and my nationality
              is Vietnamese. Currently I can express my words and communicate in
              English fluently. Additionally, I can comprehend some basic
              sentences of Spanish. I have a huge devotion with coding since I
              was in my secondary school. On top of that, I usually play
              badminton and basketball with my friends in my free time to
              mitigate the stress after a diligent period, as a rule I will have
              dinner with my family or playing online games such as League of
              Legends, Valorant. I have participated in some coding courses,
              especially the C++ and C# course, reading some IT books,
              discovering the Information Technology sector to crave for my
              desire. Hence, I will have to choose the next home port after I
              have graduated high school and RMIT University that is a
              quintessential environment for me to uncover the erudite work of
              the IT area. Hopefully I hope I will go through my university life
              effortlessly, make many good friends, and get myself equipped with
              many useful knowledge of IT that I could serve for my dream job in
              the long run.

              The one and only progress delayed is that we started to do our
              final assignment later than other groups. After the assignment 2
              deadline is the Christmas break week, we are way too enjoy our
              breaktime so that we forget to start the final assignment early.
              In addition, the amount of assignments of other courses come in
              the same time so when doing the others assignment, we forgot to
              start the assignment right after we finished assignment 2.
              Besides, the transition from assignment 2 to the final assignment
              was very smooth because we have all the ideas. If the due of the
              assignment was extended, we are really confident that we could

            In four members of our group, there is just Kiet that directly
            interesting in game development as a vocation. Conversely, Minh’s
            interest is to become a backend developer so he will have the
            speciality in working with the databases, business logic such as the
            requirements of the customers and especially the system. Khuong’s
            desired job is become an IT support, he will have the strength in
            doing the server’s maintenance, configure computer systems and
            diagnose the hardware. Finally, Doanh’s ambition is a web developer,
            she will be very suitable for developing our project since our
            project was developed on a website platform. Nonetheless, all the
            member’s future job are incompatible, they still have the suitable
            roles in the project.
