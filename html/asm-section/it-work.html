          <dl style = "margin-bottom: 10px">
            <div class="geninfo">1. Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</div>
            <dd><q>My job title is a business system analyst, so the company I'm working for is like a corporation. It’s
                different to a normal company where all the clients are members, so corporation - which works by members
                only.
                So, the system itself that I'm supporting or providing is an insurance system. Basically, my role would
                overlook at the improvement of the system, any troubleshooting of any problem, releasing new functions
                and
                help business to do testing of new systems or new functionality. That’s the core of it.</q></dd>
            <br>
            <div class="geninfo">2. Please tell us about the industry you work in.</div>
            <dd><q>The company-like-mentioned is a cooperation. It’s called Capricorn Society and what it does is
                providing
                a
                finance system relating to automobile industry, members will be able to buy through selected supplier.
                And
                the
                account would be built through Capricorn and all the account is managed through Capricorn. Also, they
                can
                do
                insurance which is buying covering protections for their businesses or personal properties.</q></dd>
            <br>
            <div class="geninfo">3. What other kinds of work do you have to do?</div>
            <dd><q>The system itself is a third-party software and it's basically an insurance, so obviously, the
                Members
                basically would have, for example, an automobile repair workshop and they would need a protection to
                cover
                their buildings or their workmanship or the equipment, so what we cover is the protection for them and
                they
                basically get a quote and that would give them protection if anything happened. So, from insurance point
                of
                view, you manage their cover and then if there's any accident, you would cover the claim so they would
                raise
                a
                claim for an incident, and you'll basically process and pay them off and basically go through and that's
                what
                the whole business is. So, the system itself helps that process in managing or collecting the premium
                for
                the
                protection and then also does the claim processing. So basically, if they claim and there is a repair
                required
                so we would arrange for repairers, make the payment to the repairers, or make the payments to Members
                and
                then
                complete the work. So, for the nature of the work, my role is basically supporting that system, so I
                mean
                I
                don't have to use the system, but there will be occasionally problem or the user is not familiar with
                certain
                functionality, then they would contact me for advice. And also, sometimes we have got new features
                introduced
                so my role would be also to manage that deployment of the new functions or vice versa if the business
                requires
                new functionality, we would ask the vendor to incorporate that new basically getting a quote, as in how
                much
                it will cost; give them to specific requirements; and manage to testing and the roll out of the new
                functionality. So that's really the core of it.</q></dd>
            <br>
            <div class="geninfo">4. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.</div>
            <dd><q>OK, so my claim or my customer mainly are the employee within the company. So, it will be the people
                in
                the
                claim department or the people in the customer services that use the system itself so the end users, but
                they
                are within the company and so I deal with them mainly. Then obviously we would deal with external vendor
                -
                that's the company that I look after the software. So those are the two main areas or customers that I
                support
                on a day-to-day basis and obviously with the internal IT so we pretty much have an in-house IT group.
                So,
                in
                some company you're aware that there is an outsource certain functionality where in our organization we
                have
                it all in house. So, the only thing is the software vendor itself, so any particular software
                enhancement
                to
                the system will be done through this particular company, but otherwise, infrastructure support would be
                within
                the company.</q></dd>
            <br>
            <div class="geninfo">5. Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</div>
            <dd><q>OK, so in terms of interaction with other IT so we got an IT department so that they’re mainly
                providing
                a
                first level support for all issues or incident lock. So, for example a customer will log up in and if
                they
                couldn't even access the system. So that's a first level. So that's someone else deal with it, that's an
                IT
                service desk group. And if there's any errors or problems specifically to the insurance system then they
                will
                escalate to myself. So, we call ourselves a second or third level support and then, well, part of my
                role
                is
                basically investigating what is the problem so it could sometime come down to a hardware problem. It's
                more
                a
                network or infrastructure problem, so there would be in IT infrastructure side which I could escalate to
                if
                it's a software issues then it's either I can resolve it. If it's not, then, again escalated to the
                vendor
                who
                does the software. If it's a software bug, that's when I would escalate to the external. So, the
                developer
                themselves is an external. So, because the system itself is owned by a third company, so all development
                and
                bug fixes are done by them, so that's where I would interact with them in that way.</q></dd>
            <br>
            <div class="geninfo">6. What about your interactions with clients or investors?</div>
            <dd><q>OK, so because our Capricorn have got different divisions, so the division, which is called at risk
                division, is basically looking after the insurance side, so they would be my main stakeholder. And there
                will
                be different managers, so there's a combination of the claim sections - the customer service and also
                the
                finance department within the Risk division so they would be potentially my customer that I deal with in
                regard to the system that I support.</q></dd>
            <div class="geninfo" style = "margin-left: 35px;">How do you deal with them?</div>
            <dd><q>OK, yeah, so basically, as a day-to-day, I would have requests from the-end-users on how to use the
                system
                or troubleshoot any problem but we have an ongoing fortnightly support that basically to prioritize work
                requests like it could be a small box or it could be an enhancement. So basically, if you could
                understand,
                there's always new requests coming through and the vendor themselves have a capacity, I mean, limited
                resources that they can deal with, so it's not like you could request for five enhancements and they can
                do
                it
                all at once. So basically, they would just put through their requests and we will say: OK these are
                parity
                and
                it's driven by, I guess, the importance or also legislation, so we might have certain legislation or
                auditing
                requirements that come in that's of high priority. Then they need to take higher priority. So basically,
                we
                have an ongoing meeting with the different stakeholders for them to decide what needs to go in first.
                Obviously, everything is driven by the business themselves, so they know and they will basically request
                for
                certain type of work needs to go in through first and being the person who coordinate between the
                business
                and
                the IT or the vendor. I'm pretty much of a middle person to discuss with them.</q></dd>
            <br>
            <div class="geninfo">7. What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</div>
            <dd><q>Oh, well, so we recently just went through an upgrade. So basically, the software was an older
                version
                and
                we went through an upgrade, so part of the upgrade and that was a project that we set up. So basically,
                just
                test every functionality that come through from the business point of view because there's no system is
                bug
                free, so we just have to make sure that the way that we work for the system. So, we went through very
                extensive testing and working with business as well to make sure that all their current operations are
                supported by this new software. So that was the upgrade, so that's why ongoing project that took about
                four
                months for that to happen. But other than that, there will be a day today, so what we call is a
                business-as-usual, if you probably heard about BAU. So really, that's what my normal role is, to provide
                the
                business-as-usual support, which means that day-to-day operations or process improvement, if need to,
                but
                basically work with business to make sure that their everyday is working, provide additional reports or
                ad
                hoc
                and query for whatever reason that they need, but yeah.</q></dd>
            <br>
            <div class="geninfo">8. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</div>
            <dd><q>Uh-huh, because being in this role, I don't need to do the technical side in terms of like the coding
                side
                so that the most challenging I guess or rewarding also is setting-in and expectation of the customer; or
                explaining them a new concept or new roles. So basically, when you deal with different Business or they
                have
                a
                different level of understanding of an IT, so I am able to talk to them in the level they understand and
                translate that into the system could be sometimes challenging. Because, for example, we deal with the
                accountant people, I think their brain works different to ours. So, it's basically trying to understand
                and
                come to a middle ground. That's probably the most challenging and rewarding as well in my role.</q></dd>
            <br>
            <div class="geninfo">9. Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT
              industry?</div>
            </dt>
            <dd><q>Well, I guess being a system analyst, so our role is to analyze and understand how the whole system
                works.
                Uh, so being able to work with the business and I guess the key point is to work collaboratively with
                them
                and
                you need to have a clear communication And, yeah. And I guess, well-organized, sometimes you always have
                requests coming through in all sorts of areas. So, I guess to be organized is quite important. So, time
                management and organization are also important in this sort of role.</q></dd>
        </div>
      </div>
      </dl>
      <div id = "heading" style = "font-size: 40px; text-align: left; margin-top: 0px;">After listening to the interviewee, our answers for the following questions:</div>
      <div class="format2">
        <dl>
          <div class="geninfo">1. What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</div>
          <dd>Besides the coding field, IT professionals can also be those who work on different tasks. Some companies
            will
            hire IT professionals to maintain their wide range of networks of computer systems, including testing,
            building,
            installing, repairing the hardware and software within the complex computer systems locally or remotely.
            Thus,
            IT professionals can be those who work directly with the coding, fixing bugs and maintaining the company
            computing networks; or the people who help with the business side, communicating, analyzing data, and
            testing.
            Moreover, there is other people who work in IT field but their main role are managers, which they know both
            IT
            and business issues that can help leverage company in scalable environment.</dd>
          <br>
          <div class="geninfo">2. What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals?
              Clients?
              Investors? The general public?</div>
          <dd>IT professionals can interact with either other people of the same profession, customers, clients or other
            company investors. Those people could be within the company or the software vendors or even end-users.</dd>
          <br>
          <div class="geninfo">3. Where do the IT professionals spend most of their time?</div>
          <dd>The time-spending depends on the task of which IT professionals has to do. In terms of working location,
            with
            the nature of the internet, it is easier nowadays to work-from-home while maintaining work notwithstanding.
            Hence, IT professionals can spend most of their time at their accommodations and work on their personal
            devices.
            On the other hand, some companies require them to interact with the host computer, so the IT professionals
            handling the tasks will then spend most of their time working at the company locations so that they can have
            exclusive access to the network or server.
            In terms of the working aspect, the IT professionals will spend most times on maintaining the network when
            there
            is a coming update, including testing and working with the business side, and the technical sides to assure
            the
            new updates work and adapt. Therefore, when there is a new upgrade, the ongoing projects that may take
            months
            for them to complete.
          </dd>
          <br>
          <div class="geninfo">4. What aspect of their position is most challenging?</div>
          <dd>Some professional IT will deal with the technical side of the work, which is the coding side. Some, on the
            other hand, deals with the business side of the work, which is to come into the middle round and explain the
            IT
            knowledge for both sides to understand and work with each other. Beside from interacting directly with the
            complex computing system itself, it is also challenging to get the people who have different level of
            understanding the IT field to cooperate. </dd>
