        time for meeting and the one who connects to the interviewee which leads
        to successful interview. She is a bit shy but she continuously proves
        that she is an active person. For work, she is always on time for task
        and try to do as best as she can.
        <br>
        For Khuong, he is a kind and mid shy and social guy, who is the fun of
        the whole group, but when in work, he is very responsible to be on time
        and try his best for tasks although he is not at SGS campus right now
        and be somewhere in Hoi An. Moreover, he is very generous and ready to
        help others when needed.
        <br>
        For Kiet, he is a social and energetic man. He is fearlessly trying to
        do things that he has never done before. In addition, he is a little bit
        careless but is a responsible guy, especially for working for the logic

        good sense of humor, which helps our team work together better because

        Doanh, despite her shyness, is willing to discuss every aspect of our
        project that is crucial to its success. Her contribution to our research
        is significant because she helped connect us with an expert interviewee
        and provided many helpful ideas. She is nice and helpful to me, and it
        is possible that we share some common interests with others. During our
        meeting, she shows a high level of professionalism in her work by paying
        great attention and picks up on new information rapidly.

        Kiet, in the beginning, has captured my attention with his eagerness and
        activeness. He is attempting things that he has never done before with
        no fear of failure. He is also a reliable and trustworthy person, and he
        is known for completing his tasks on time. In addition, his appearance
        is quite appealing, and how he communicates with others appears to be

        Being a team leader, Minh has been very dedicated to every one of us. He
        listens to our opinions, responds and gives helpful feedbacks as well as
        advices. He was the one who wrote the coding for our project and
        contributed a huge part at it. He is also a nice and warm person who
        does not hesitate to share thoughts and experiences to us. I am glad to
        have a leader who is very responsible for his work, someone who trusts
        and encourages us to take on new challenges.
        <br>
        In addition to Khuong, I personally think he is a very nice, sociable
        and intelligent person. Despite not being able to meet with us
        face-to-face and all the communications have been made remotely via
        video calls, he is always a responsible guy for any work and duty he was
        assigned to. I believe we share a few things in common, hence, talking
        to him is very comfortable.
        <br>
        Last but not least, Kiet is an energetic and friendly teammate. He is a
        very accountable and trustworthy guy for his responsibility in finishing
        his work on time. Moreover, His passion for coding shown in his
        enthusiasm to our project is very admiring. He also seems to be a very
        outgoing guy by his confident and cheerful characteristic.
