          <div class ="content">
            Blockchain is a distributed database which is shared among computer networks. It stores electronic information in digital form. Moreover, blockchain is an innovation which secure and validate data itself and do not depend on any organizations, which is why it is the technology that people lean on to secure personal data as well as validate their existed data to others, the data is always transparent in this case. This technology has already been implemented in industry and will soon dominate in 5 years' time. Lastly, blockchain is built on 4 main concepts [1]:<br>
          </div>
  
          <ul style ="list-style-type: disc;", class ="content">
            <li>Distributed ledger: everyone can have access to it within the computer networks.</li>
            <li>Cryptographic: based on crypto functions to ensure the integrity and security of the information.</li>
            <li>Personalize: each participant confirms the changes with others, no need of third-party organization for validation.</li>
            <li>Can run additional business logic: developers can implement more business requirements based on various aspects, for example: smart contract with transaction or asset embedded into blockchain.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class ="content">
            Blockchain holds data in a block, a chain of blocks is considered to hold larger amount of data corresponding to the users. Each block concludes some important attributes, previous block Hash, current data, timestamp, current block Hash. Current block Hash is the cryptography to encrypted data, in this case is the combination of data, timestamp and previous hash. Therefore, the hash will link block into a unbreakable chains, if hackers try to get access to one block, they must know the key to decrypt the block and also need to change other block as well (because they are linked, if one block is fake, the other block hash will show that one block is getting modified) and the owner will know as soon as possible, because everybody has access to it, therefore hackers will get exposed.
          </div>
          <div class ="content">
            Each participant inside blockchain will then decrypted the block to investigate the data inside and validate it using the cryptography function behind, and then boomed, the blockchain process completed, a block is added to the chain, and holds history of transaction between users.
          </div>
          <div class ="content">
            In a result, blockchain is considered a technology for individual action which is proof to others that the data is transparent and secure enough to be entrusted.
          </div>
          <div class ="content">
            Blockchain innovation will impact any industry which requires heavy security. For example: bank, finance, real estate, supply chain. [2]
          </div>
          <div class ="content">
            For banks and finance, people can feel secure where they put money into the bank because of high security and transparency. Real estate can hold transactions of each user of the land to make it obvious and the process will be much faster because the data is correct which does not need any organization to verify. Supply chain can prove its products original as well as its quality through blockchain that helps consumer feel secure and pleased to buy the product.
          </div>
          <div class ="content">
            With this modern technology and rise of cryptocurrency, the government can get discharged because they will no longer control the transparent of transaction anymore. For example, in real estate, each person wants to buy the land need to contact higher authority, which is the government for their land occupation and transaction, with the help of blockchain, the data is secured enough for individual to process next step in the transaction themselves.
          </div>
          <div class ="content">
            In our daily life, blockchain will help us wake up in the morning feeling secure that our digital bank account or any important asset online will be secured and transparent. We will not need to scare of scram news that different bank authorities got hacked. We can worry less about our parents fearing losing money or any asset which information kept online, or even buy healthy food or not, because the food data is kept in blockchain that we already know their original and time of production, etc.

          <h3 id ="heading2" style = "text-align: center; margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px">Cyber security and privacy</h3>
          <div class ="content">
            The process of protecting computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from hostile intrusions is referred to as cybersecurity. It is also known as information technology security or electronic data security. Cybersecurity and privacy are intimately related, and they are also two of the most critical factors in determining the overall safety of our technology-based society. Similar to how technology is becoming increasingly crucial for societal and economic benefits, a range of cybersecurity threats and dangers are emerging, resulting in many new security issues. Cybersecurity professionals are continuously on the lookout for new ways to safeguard their clients' and customers' personal information. The phrase "cybersecurity and privacy" is used in various sectors, ranging from business to mobile computing, and it can be classified into numerous categories [3]:
          </div>
          <ul style ="list-style-type: disc;", class ="content">
            <li>Network security is the practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware.</li>
            <li>Application security protects software and devices from malware A hacked app may expose data it was meant to secure. Security is built into software and devices from the start.</li>         
            <li>Information security protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit.</li>
            <li>Operational security includes the processes and decisions that govern the handling and protection of data assets. This includes the rights that users have while accessing a network as well as the protocols that govern how and where data can be kept or shared.</li>
            <li>Disaster recovery and business continuity is an organization's response to a cyberattack or other loss of data. Policies control how an organization restores operations and data after a disaster. It is a strategy used when resources are limited.</li>
            <li>End-user education handles the most unexpected aspect of cyber security: people. Anyone can unintentionally transmit a virus into a protected system by not following proper security protocols. Teaching employees to discard suspicious email attachments, not to use unrecognized USB drives, and other security teachings is vital.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class ="content">
            Cybercriminals often have the equivalent technical skills as cyber security experts. As a result, cybercrime is always changing, outsmarting sophisticated cyber security solutions. With increasing methods available to sneak into systems and networks, cyber warfare is heating up. Many attacks on critical infrastructures, such as hospitals, water systems, and power grids, have occurred. On a lesser level, ransomware and virus attacks on enterprise networks have increased. No cyber security system is or will ever be flawless. To strengthen cyber security, it is important to identify and adopt innovative technology continually. Some leading advanced cyber security technologies could be mentioned are [4]: 
          </div>
          <ul style ="list-style-type: disc;", class ="content">
            <li>Artificial Intelligence & Deep Learning: Two-factor authentication combining with AI is also one of the application of cybersecurity. Two parameters are used to validate a user's identification, and the parameters are known to the user. Then AI comes into play. Potential threats and unauthorized activities are identified by reviewing records, transactions, and real-time contacts.</li>
            <li>Behavioral Analytics: Behavioral analytics detects habits in system and network activity to identify cyber threats in real-time. One user's device's unusually high data transmission rate may indicate a cyber security issue. Behavioral analytics is increasingly being used in systems and user devices.</li>
            <li>Embedded Hardware Authentication: A PIN and password are no longer sufficient to protect hardware. Embedded authenticators are new identity verification technologies. Intel's sixth-generation vPro Chips represent a major breakthrough in this area. These powerful user authentication chips are built-in. These combine multiple levels and methods of authentication to revolutionize “authentication security”.</li>
            <li>Blockchain Cybersecurity: Blockchain cyber security is a newer technology that is gaining popularity. The blockchain technology relies on two parties identifying themselves. Similarly, blockchain cyber security relies on the technology's peer-to-peer network principles. A blockchain's member is responsible for verifying the data they add. Blockchains also create a nearly impenetrable network for hackers, making them our best bet for data security right now. Thus, combining blockchain and AI can create a robust verification system to keep cyber threats at bay.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class ="content">
            As we all know, the negative consequences of cyber-attacks frequently occur in a multi-sectoral environment, such as the business, tourist, and hospitality industries... In a wider sense, cyber attackers are becoming increasingly prevalent, infiltrating systems and stealing large amounts of information, resulting in a loss of clients and revenue that may be estimated in millions or even billions of dollars. More broadly, it has the potential to disrupt or interfere with the flow of information, resulting in injury or even death in rare instances. However, thanks to advancements in cybersecurity, many threats are being identified and stopped before they have a chance to have a negative impact on society. Many well-known companies believe that cyber threats may be prevented by implementing a set of security procedures. As a result, they're developing standards and definitions of good practice, all of which are based on the same mindset that led to the first cyber security management standards being established 25 years ago. The world, on the other hand, has changed. Standard good practice approaches are still required, but they are inadequate to protect businesses from today's threats. The rules are important, but as attackers' intelligence and desire increase, we must adjust our security strategy - and outsmart cyber criminals [5]. 
          </div>
          <div class ="content">
            In my opinion, cyber security will have little effect on my life for a variety of reasons. To begin with, the merits of cyber security are obvious on a broader scale, such as in business or in securing information for huge businesses,..., but they are not obvious to me, personally. Among other things, cyber security merely helps me in the protection of private information such as personal and financial data, secrets, payments, and login information. It is likely that if this information is made public, I will be easily targeted by attackers utilizing their automated mass targeting software, which is common in today's society. As a result, the development of cyber security may keep me safe to a certain extent. The fact that the majority of my relatives and friends are youngsters or elderly people means that their understanding of cyber risks is limited, at best. As a result, advancements in cyber security may be beneficial to them in specific sectors. First and foremost, when they go online, their financial information will be kept confidential, making it difficult for any attackers to use it for malicious purposes. Second, because of the presence of many recent security software programs, any risks can be discovered early, allowing my family and friends to stop them manually or, in some cases, automatically, before they become a serious problem. Finally, owing to cyber security, my family and friends will be able to use technical equipment without being concerned about their safety [6].

          <div class ="content">
            “The Cloud” is colloquial term used the service that utilizes the concept of cloud computing. Cloud computing is a dense cluster of computers working together in a way that to a normal observer, they all appear to be one giant computing resources. That resource can be anything related to computing and computer, such as software, hardware, network infrastructure to servers and large networks of servers. Cloud computing provides faster and simpler scalability for scaling up or down. Moreover, Server storage and maintenance are offered by cloud service providers who manage and maintain the server, which help reducing the expense and space needed. Cloud computing systems offer much better security and also have robust disaster recovery measures in place to ensure high-speed and easier data recovery.

            Cloud computing has two types of models: Deployment models and Service models.
          </div>
          <ul style ="list-style-type: disc;", class ="content">
            <li>Deployment models which include Public Cloud, Private Cloud and Hybrid Cloud. The Cloud infrastructure is available to the public over the Internet and owned by cloud service providers called Public Cloud. With the Private cloud, the Cloud infrastructure is exclusively operated by a single organization and it can be managed by the organization or a third party. A hybrid cloud is a combination of the functionalities of both public and private clouds.</li>
            <li>The three major service models of cloud computing include Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS); Platform as a Service (PaaS); and Software as a Service (SaaS). Each type of cloud provides different levels of control, flexibility, and management:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>“IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) which is the lowest layer in a Cloud Infrastructure and offers a poll of Virtual Machines for computing and storage, </li>
                <li>PaaS (Platform as a Service) is the middle layer which allows deploying applications, </li>
                <li>SaaS (Software as a Service) the top layer, that offers accessible user applications like IBM Bluemix, OPENSHIFT, Google App Engine, Heroku and Microsoft Azure.” [7]</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
          <div class ="content">
            Nowadays, the state of art implementations of cloud computing includes Architectural Design of Data Centre; Distributed File System over Cloud; and Distributed Application Framework over cloud [8]. Cloud computing trends are to shift focus from cloud adoption to cloud optimizing. What can be done now is to change enterprise IT architecture; increase security and privacy issues. Therefore, the future of Cloud computing is growing brighter and brighter. Moreover, it was analyzed that “By 2025, the cloud will be the key driver of business innovation”, “The cloud will be at the center of most recent and emerging technological innovations: artificial intelligence, “internet of things” services, and edge and quantum computing, to name a few.” [9]. In the near future, beside the increase in security and privacy issues, cloud computing is shifting its focus from adoption to optimization. Hence, the advanced technologies associating with cloud computing will be enhanced relating to: Blockchain will be more secure; there will be more applications for Big Data & Analytics; AI and ML; and Internet of things (IoT). IoT allows devices, home appliances, cars, etc. to be connected and exchange data over the Internet. With this technology, we can lock the door remotely if we forget to do before going to work or heat up the kettle on the way home from work. By 2030, it is forecasted that about 50 billion IoT devices will be in use around the world, Global spending on IoT is also forecasted to reach $1.1 trillion by 2022. IoT will definitely be needing cloud computing for all sorts of data storage. Hence, for any further development in the future, IoT will be needing Big Data which associates with Cloud computing and Data Analytics. Nowadays, more and more data processing machine-to-machine communication models are taking place. We can do it easily with the help of Cloud Computing.
          </div>
          <div class ="content">
            With the growth of modern technology, IoT which stands for Internet of things could be anything around us. It is the ability to connect any devices with one another via internet, or other networks which can create a huge network of connected devices, from smartphones to kitchen appliances and so on. IoT is the source of data, and cloud computing is the location of storage, scale and speed of the accessibility. To put it simply, IoT and Cloud computing complement each other, and “cloud computing is a critical technology to support decision-making systems for IoT-based applications” [10]. IoT devices impact society in a meaningful way, such as the reduction on energy and costs. Smart health devices can provide healthcare system: the patients’ health can be monitored remotely while still able to receive urgent assistance. Additionally, it will likely have huge impacts on agriculture as in the term of smart agriculture and all different aspects of industries. IoT will provide the solution to achieve system capability in dealing with complexity and decentralization for decision-making activities [10] We can easily witness the positive impact of IoT on citizens, businesses and governments, while citizens will be the ones benefit from it the most. We will be more secure on our information, yet able to connect and interact with everything in our houses. This development brings convenience, speedy and comfortable ways to interact with literally any object in our house. Thus, IoT shifts the lives of us to automation trends and driving us to the new era of technology. On the other hand, it is hard to ignore a few but huge negative impact that it may bring to employment. This new technology can significantly reduce the current job opportunities with automation while replacing them with careers that require and higher-level of academic.
          </div>
          <div class ="content">
            Cloud computing will impact our working style, as well as the era of technology generally. It allows workers, students or anyone to access data anywhere, anytime with many benefits. It is much easy to connect with friend and people through online community. For instance, Music and video live stream, online gaming are the concrete proof of how greatly cloud computing has impacted us. Furthermore, most online shopping platforms are using cloud nowadays. Hence, the features will provide members of our family better customer experience. Aside from social impact, cloud computing technology has seen to have moved medical healthcare industry from the traditional intranet to a faster and more secure method. Additionally, Cloud computing has enabled navigation programs to store a huge amount of data with annually updates which will come in handy for our travels. Cloud computing technology is very convenient and accessible to any of us, it is where we can utilize every aspect to solutions of problems along with the dramatically reduced storage costs and high security. Cloud computing has become a critical part in our lives and will continue to grow into different forms that will take the normal way we live nowadays to a higher level.

          <h3 id ="heading2" style = "text-align: center; margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px">Artificial Intelligence</h3>
          <div class ="content">
            Intelligent machines, such as numerical computers or computer-controlled robots, have the ability to perform tasks that are normally performed by intelligent beings. It is usually used to refer to a project involving the development of an artificial intelligence system that is capable of performing cognitive functions similar to those found in humans. Among these include the ability to reason, clarify what is being said by bringing the meaning into focus, generalizing, and learning from the past to improve current problem-solving abilities. [11]
          </div>
          <div class ="content">
            A century has passed since the invention of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is still in its early stages. However, it has made significant progress in spite of these challenges. This topic has piqued the interest of many technologists around the world, and many companies from a variety of industries are eager to learn more about its possibilities because of the rapid development that has been made. In order to obtain a deeper understanding of a profession that has accomplished so much in such a short period of time, it is essential that those who wish to work in Artificial Intelligence research the field's roots, current developments, and future expansion potential. Beginning with its conception and on through its current state and future prospects in many industries, this paper summarizes the significant development made in Artificial Intelligence. Turing machines and Turing tests are discussed, as are historical developments in artificial intelligence, expert systems, big data, and robotics. It also discusses current developments in artificial intelligence across a wide range of domains, as well as potential future study avenues [12].
          </div>
          <div class ="content">
            While AI technologies are being upgraded, there are a number of jobs that AI could perform for the time being. As an example, artificial intelligence is currently transforming web search, finance, logistics, and other industries. … During the next three years, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to dominate the technology section on a global scale. AI may eventually replace human beings in some specific sections, such as the production line, and advance smart home technology, such as the virtual assistant, to a higher level of sophistication. Apart from that, the categories of Artificial Intelligence can be classified into four distinct types [13]:
          </div>
          <ul style ="list-style-type: disc;", class ="content">
            <li>Reactive machines: In their most elementary forms, artificial intelligence systems are entirely reactive, but they also have the ability to develop memories and draw on previous experience to make current judgments. To give you an example, IBM's chess-playing supercomputer, which beat the world champion Garry Kasparov in the late 1990s, is an example. This type of intelligence entails the computer directly viewing the world and acting on what it observes. It is not founded on a preconceived notion of the world.</li>
            <li>Limited memory: Type II machines are those that can look back in time. Some of this could already be accomplished by self-driving automobiles. For example, they make observations about the speed and direction of other cars. That cannot be accomplished in a single instant, but rather involves the identification of certain things and the subsequent monitoring of those objects over time. These observations are integrated with the preprogrammed characterizations of the world created by the self-driving cars, which include lane markers, traffic signals, and other critical components such as curves in the road. They are used when the car chooses whether to change lanes to prevent being cut off by another driver or being collided with by a neighboring vehicle. Despite the fact that these brief snippets of information about the past are just temporary. There is no way for them to be saved as part of the car's library of experience from which it can learn, in the same way that human drivers accumulate experience over years behind the wheel.</li>
            <li>Theory of mind: Next, more advanced, classes of machines not only form representations of the world, but also of other agents or things in the world, which is referred to as meta-representations. "Theory of mind" is the term used in psychology to describe the concept that people, creatures, and things all across the world can have thoughts and emotions that influence their own behavior. The theory of mind is critical to understanding how we humans established civilizations since it enables us to engage in social relationships with one other. Working together is at best difficult, and at worst impossible, if we don't comprehend each other's motivations and goals, and if we don't take into consideration what someone else knows about me or the surroundings.</li>
            <li>Self-awareness: The final phase in artificial intelligence development is to create systems that are capable of forming representations of themselves. We artificial intelligence researchers will eventually have to not just study consciousness, but also construct robots that possess it. Aware of themselves, conscious beings are aware of their own states, and they can forecast the sentiments of others. We believe that someone honking behind us in traffic is angry or irritated because that is how we feel when we honk at others.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class ="content">
            When Artificial Intelligence becomes widely available, it is certain that it will have some potential consequences, both positive and harmful. The first potential benefit is that artificial intelligence can raise the living standards of apartment residents in general and the residents of the residence in particular. The development of virtual assistant technology will make human being’s daily lives easier, their daily duties such as cleaning the house, adjusting the lighting, and maintaining security will be managed by artificial intelligence. Additional implications of artificial intelligence include the ability to reduce the amount of work that employees at manufacturing facilities must perform by self-installing the components of the product, such as vehicles and computers, to reduce the amount of labor they must perform. A new stage of technology, called as "4.0 Technology," will be introduced into each part of society, including engineering, education, and even daily living. The advancement of Artificial Intelligence has the potential to greatly benefit humans and, as a result, to raise their living standards. Ironically, the advancement of artificial intelligence has its drawbacks, and those who work in the field of information technology in general, and developers in particular, will be the most adversely affected. AI will assist people in finishing their work more quickly and will encourage the working process to develop a specific program. However, as artificial intelligence advances, it will eventually replace the developer profession and may even completely replace some programming languages. In the not-too-distant future, artificial intelligence (AI) will be able to construct programs on its own by integrating algorithms and knowledge from the past, making the developer's work obsolete.
          </div>
          <div class ="content">
            Artificial Intelligence will have a tremendous impact on our daily lives, as well as the lives of our team members' friends and family. We can perform the house duties by instructing the artificial intelligence to do so. Furthermore, we can ask the AI to look for the information on our behalf, and it will do so. In the education sector, artificial intelligence (AI) will digitalize textbooks for us, allowing us to open the textbook without having to bring it with us. Aside from that, the AI-powered robots can monitor our health state by logging our emotions in a database, and we may move from one location to another just by sitting in an autonomous car. To summarize the benefits of the development of artificial intelligence, AI will be a critical technology for improving the quality of life and living standards over time. Each respective area, such as education, healthcare, transportation, media, and especially the IT field, will be upgraded and become more modern as a result of the development of AI.
